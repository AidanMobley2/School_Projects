# High-Resolution Painting Scanner

## Summary

For my senior design engineering class, I created a high-resolution painting scanner prototype with two teammates. It is supposed to offer high spatial resolution and high color resolution. It uses a monochrome camera and takes pictures of the painting close enough to offer 600 ppi or more spatial resolution. It uses a monochrome camera to collect more frequency information than a standard color camera which only collects red, green, and blue light. The final design will use many more frequencies of light to allow artists to have fine control over how their painting's scan will look and be able to simulate being lit by different light sources. We picked out 11 different color LEDs that evenly cover the whole visible spectrum but we tested our prototype with only red, green, and blue LEDs. This is because, as we discovered several times during the project, it is trickier than we thought to get each frequency of light to illuminate the painting evenly and consistently. Most of the time spent in this project was trying to design a lighting system that was small enough to fit on the scanner, cheap enough to fall within our budget, and high-quality enough to create a very realistic scan of the painting. The camera is mounted to a modified CNC router and Gcode commands are used to move the camera from section to section to scan the entire painting. Our prototype can scan a 9 in by 9.5 in painting but the final design will be able to accommodate a 2 ft by 3 ft painting.
